# mon - a command line utility for Pokémon

Uses art from [pokemon-colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts) and Pokémon data from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

In order for it to work the `colorscripts/` folder has to be in the same path as the built binary, once I learn how to properly use `cargo` this may change in the future...
