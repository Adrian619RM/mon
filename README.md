# mon - a command line utility for Pokémon

Uses art from [pokemon-colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts) and Pokémon data from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

Tested on:
```
> rustc --version
rustc 1.54.0 (a178d0322 2021-07-26)
```

A simple `cargo build --release` should be enough, you can place the built binary somewhere in your path and just run `mon [pokemon name or id]`
